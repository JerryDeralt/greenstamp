"Following a meeting between Chinese and Russian leaders on September 2, 2025, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Russian citizens holding ordinary passports will be eligible for visa-free entry into China from September 15, 2025 to September 14, 2026. Under this trial policy, Russian nationals can enter China without a visa for purposes such as business, tourism and sightseeing, visiting family or friends, cultural or academic exchanges, and transit. The maximum stay allowed is 30 days, and travelers must not exceed this duration. This move is part of China’s broader effort to facilitate international exchanges and optimize entry policies."

					<h1>About This Project</h1>
					This project helps people travelling to China see if they can benefit from Chinese visa exemption policies. These policies allow you to stay in China for a duration without having to apply a Chinese visa beforehand and without having to do extensive paperwork/contact/documents. 
					<br>
					<br>
					This project also aims to keep everything transparent. In addition to the assumptions stated below, there will be annotations and links leading to external/official sources; content I put here are often paraphrased, so it is always recommend that you look at the sources for yourselves to check for subtleties and other legal details to avoid confusion.
					<br>
					<br>
					This project is dedicated to mainland China and as such will not be covering any visa exemption policies for entering Hongkong, Macau, or Taiwan.
					<br>
					<br>
					Lastly, this is a personal project, and as such, any and all feedback/suggestions are appreciated. If there's anything bothering you or you'd like to see implemented, please reach out
					<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/Q1iDtgaV5R">here</a>!
					<h2>Assumption: Durations in Months</h2>
					Covention denotes that 1 month corresponds to 30 days, a pattern present in many Chinese publications. By extension, 3 months correspond to 90 days, 6 months to 180 days, etc. For consistency in policy durations, all measurements of "months" have been converted to their equivalent in "days".
					<h2>Link Colors</h2>
					Links in blue or green refer to external sources. Green-colored links are in Chinese, and blue-colored links are in English.
